This is the code that powers http://wiki.alcidesfonseca.com

It is a django app being served by apache with passenger running in slicehost. you might want to change the settings and the public/media folder, so it follows django's standards.

There are a few dependencies, so you should run @pip install -r requirements.txt@ before starting up.

Feedback appreciated to me@alcidesfonseca.com
